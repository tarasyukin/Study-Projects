abstract = {Older people living in squalor present healthcare providers with a set of complex issues because squalor occurs alongside a variety of medical and psychiatric conditions, and older people living in squalor frequently decline intervention. To synthesise empirical evidence on squalor to inform ethical decision-making in the management of squalor using the bioethical framework of principlism. A systematic literature search was conducted using Medline, Embase, {PsycINFO} and {CINAHL} databases for empirical research on squalor in older people. Given the limited evidence base to date, an interpretive approach to synthesis was used. Sixty-seven articles that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review. Our synthesis of the research evidence indicates that: (i) older people living in squalor have a high prevalence of frontal executive dysfunction, medical comorbidities and premature deaths; (ii) interventions are complex and require interagency involvement, with further evaluations needed to determine the effectiveness and potential harm of interventions; and (iii) older people living in squalor utilise more medical and social resources, and may negatively impact others around them. These results suggest that autonomous decision-making capacity should be determined rather than assumed. The harm associated with squalid living for the older person, and for others around them, means a non-interventional approach is likely to contravene the principles of non-maleficence, beneficence and justice. Adequate assessment of decision-making capacity is of particular importance. To be ethical, any intervention undertaken must balance benefits, harms, resource utilisation and impact on others. \copyright 2022 The Authors.
