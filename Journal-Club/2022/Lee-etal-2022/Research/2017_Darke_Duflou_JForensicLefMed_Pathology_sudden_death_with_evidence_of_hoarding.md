## Patients

All cases presenting to the Department of Forensic Medicine Sydney (DOFM) between 1 January 2001&#8212;31 September 2015 where

%% Patients included, need to note number, exclusion criteria, how they were recruited, etc %% 

## Intervention 

%% some studies don't have an intervention, essentially what was being tested for %%

## Control  

%% some studies may not have a clear control population %%

## Outcome  

%% what was the raw results of the study %%

## Conclusion  

> [!Final Thoughts]
> In summary, the predominant clinical picture of sudden or unnatural deaths of pathological hoarders was of an isolated individual in very poor health. This is a group with a signi fi cant burden of disease that might bene fi t from more direct community level intervention.

%% what was the conclusion the researchers had come to at the end %%


## Comments and Extracts

> Hoarding Disorder has been recognised in DSM V as an independent diagnosis, characterised by an obsessive accumulation of objects causing functional impairment. The population prevalence was recently estimated at 5%, but may range up to 5%. 

> "The overall clinical picture was of an isolated group, with a heavy burden of physical disease and, in all probability, a high level of psychiatric disorders, who died alone in their homes."

abstract = {The study aimed to determine the characteristics and circumstances of cases sudden or unnatural death (n = 61) with evidence of pathological hoarding, their major organ pathology and toxicology. The mean age was 65·8 yrs (a mean of 16.1 years of potential life lost), 62·3\% were male, and 28·2\% were obese. 95·1\% lived alone, and 96·7\% died in their residence, with no medical intervention. In all cases severe squalor and extensive hoarding were noted. The direct cause of death was attributed to disease in 75·4\%, heart disease being a significant factor in 52·5\%. Accidents causing death directly related to hoarding occurred in two cases. Autopsy revealed extensive pathology: severe coronary artery narrowing (42·4\%), myocardial replacement fibrosis (44·1\%), emphysema (39·0\%), nephrosclerosis (46·6\%). Signs of hypothermia were present in 14·8\%, and diabetes was diagnosed in 21·3\%. The most commonly detected substance was alcohol (32·1\%). Medications for heart disease (5·4\%) or diabetes (7·1\%) were rare. The overall clinical picture was of an isolated group, with a heavy burden of physical disease and, in all probability, a high level of psychiatric disorders, who died alone in their homes.
