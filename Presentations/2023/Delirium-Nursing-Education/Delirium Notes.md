### Briefly on Sensitivity and Specificity

Something is sensitive if it has very few false negatives

Something is specific if it has very few false positives  

### Causes

Drugs changes  
> which drugs? how much drugs? 
> are all drug changes equal?

> I don't know how much I agree with this one. Sometimes we need to know or else the patient deteriorates and comes out worse. 

### Clinical Impact

So it seems the 1 year mortality rate for "delirium" is something like 30% but what does this actually mean. Delirium as a clinical entity remains rather nebulous without a clearly unifying pathology, but seems to be an end-state of brain "vulnerability" (itself a rather nebulous concept) which in theory be a marker of frailty and commorbidity. 

So I guess is is *DELIRIUM* that is leading to mortality, or is the fact that someone who is very vulnerable with very little physiologic reserve is getting quite sick.   

One thing I guess that delirium would lead to is deconditioning and the complications that arise from that. A delirious patient isn't getting physiotherapy, is going backwards in clinical trajectory and reversing any gains they made up to that point
