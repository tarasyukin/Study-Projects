> In patients presenting to the emergency department with delirium, there is a 70% increased risk of death at six months, and delirium in the ICU is associated with a 2 to 4-fold increased risk of overall mortality. ^[Hshieh TT, Inouye SK, Oh ES. Delirium in the Elderly. Clin Geriatr Med. 2020 May;36(2):183-199. [[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32222295)]]

1. Hyperactive Delirium: Patients present with increased agitation and sympathetic activity. They can present with hallucinations, delusions, and occasionally combative or uncooperative behavior.
2. Hypoactive Delirium: Patients have increased somnolence and decreased arousal. Hypoactive delirium is dangerous as it is often unrecognized or mistaken for fatigue or depression. It is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. 
3. Mixed Presentation: Patients can fluctuate between Hyperactive and Hypoactive presentations.


When evaluating a patient with delirium, it is crucial to speak with caregivers or other people who know the patient well. Many patients with delirium have underlying dementia, and knowing the baseline functional status of a patient is critical to knowing if acute changes have occurred.

> While true it is always safer to assume a delirium than dementia. 

Other features include alterations in the sleep-wake cycle, perceptual disturbances, delusions, inappropriate or unsafe behavior, and emotional lability
