> This is a narrative review of existing research in older patients living in squalor as there is limited quantitative evidence to direct care.

## Patients

Included studies:  
- Mean age of participanst &ge; 60 yo  
- search terms:
  - hoard, diogenes, squalor, clutter, elder, older, self-neglect, etc.

Excluded studies:
> Conference abstracts, case reports with *three or less participants*, expert opinions and review articles were excluded. The process of selection was performed by a single author (SML).

%% Patients included, need to note number, exclusion criteria, how they were recruited, etc %%  

Total studies included = 67 [N:: 67]

## Intervention 

Literature was coded based on a principilism framework:
1. Cognitive profile and that decision making 
2. Natural trajectory of squalid living 
3. Positive and Negative outcomes of intervention 
4. Utilisation of resources by older people, impact on others, and justice

%% some studies don't have an intervention, essentially what was being tested for %%

## Control  

%% some studies may not have a clear control population %%

## Outcome  

Key assertions based on principilism.
1. Cognition
    - There is a preponderance of executive dysfunction, not always rising to level of dementia [^ayers2016] [^ayers2013]
    - There is an associated with alcohol abuse/misuse [^gleason2015] - other substances not discussed
1. Natural History 
    - there is a mortality risk associated with squalor, this has not been robustly quantified, one study suggests ~ 16 years of life lost 
    - there is a higher risk of falls, elder abuse [^p1], and institutionalisation [^p2] 
1. Intervention 
    - CBT alone has minimal benefit, CBT with in-home support shows some improvement  
    - CREST[^d1] has some benefit that does not persist beyond 12 months  
    - Compassion-Focused Therapy has no strong evidence to it (this paper sites an uncontrolled study of 18 patients, I consider this essentially data-noise)  
    - Clean-ups provide some benefit to prolong tenancy  
    - Fire safety education may have modest benefit  
    - Neutering of cats has shown a reduction in animal numbers after 12 months  
1. Resource Utilisation 
    - Squalid patients typically have longer hospitalisations and discharged to supported accommodations  
    - Family and caregivers experience negative emotions, and family dysfunctions  (it is not stated if this is to a higher degree)  
    - Caregivers and volunteers require additional support as patients can be paranoid and demanding  

%% what was the raw results of the study %%

## Conclusion  

### Cognition in the Elderly living in Squalor 

The authors conclude the patients found to be living in squalor should be cautiously approached to their decision making capacity as their evidence suggests that such patients have:
1. Greater preponderence of executive dysfunction, however *not* meeting criteria for dementia  
2. Potentially have poor insight into the impact of their behaviours on their health and safety[^tolin2010], this study however is an interview series of patient families, which are an important source but does not provide convincing evidence for such patients lacking insight
3. That [[2022_Lee_Martino_Bismark_Bentley_IMJ_Older_people_living_in_squalor#^q-autonomy|"...autonomous decision-making capacity should be determined rather than assumed"]] (this quote being taken from the abstract).

### Intervention is needed to reduce morbidity and mortality, and this may need to occur against the wishes of the older adult  

The authors present a number of studies indicating a panoply of medical commordibities that have a higher propensity to lead to morbidity and moratility. The review presents rather weak evidence for high risk of falls [^arluke2017] (oddly referring to a chapter in a book on animal abuse), elder abuse [^clarke1975] (referring to a very old paper describing a case series of 30 hoarders), and "institutionalisation" [^snowdon2011], this latter study by *Snowdon & Halliday (2011)* has a quantitative breakdown of 173 patients referred to a community psychiatric service, of which 32% were in long-term care at 12 months, only 47% remained at home, and 9% had died. 

The most critical evidence (I feel) of harm associated with hoarding is a case series of sudden deaths in patients with evidence of pathological hoarding [^darke2017] which shows: 

> [!Highlights]
> - First study of deaths with evidence of pathological hoarding.
> - 95.1% lived alone, and 96.7% died in their residence, with no medical intervention.
> - The cause of death was disease in 75.4%, heart disease being a significant factor in 52.5% of cases.
> - Signs of hypothermia were present in 14.8%, and Type II diabetes in 21.3%.
> - Medications for heart disease (5.4%) or diabetes (7.1%) were rare.

In this case series there is an apparent signal, suggesting a contribution from isolation and neglect of healthcare. The expectation would be that more than 5 and 7% percent of older people with medical commorbidities would be on some form of intervention, but that data isn't presented here. 

Another study demonstrates an association of the severity of hoarding with functional disability [^ayers2013]

### Older patients living in squalor have a detrimental impact on family and caregivers, as well as a wider healthcare burden

The authors present that case that such squalid patients have broad difficulties in interpersonal interaction with their carers. With carers and family finding it difficult to understand and or cope with their charges/loved-ones' behaviour. 

Such behaviours can be refusal of care and support, and paranoia. *Lee et. al. (2022)* also suggest an ethical quandry experienced by care workes in such situations:

> [!Lee et. al. 2022] 
> "Qualitative studies involving case workers revealed that they were frequently ethically conflicted when trying to initiate change..."

The finanacial healthcare burden of such patients has only a a single study presented. *Franzini & Dyer (2008)* present expendetures of medical costs in patients (N = 131) referred to an Elder Abuse and Mistreatment Institute for evaluation of self-neglect. [^franzini2008]  

This study found no significant difference in healthcare costs of such patients compared to age-matched controls in the year following referral and evaluation. This appears to represent to healthcare cost for *that year*. However this data is of limited value to the Australian setting given its origin in Texas in the years before the *Affordable Health Act* - just saying, not sure if that is even significant, but sure is fun to point out.

Of interest to me is the study by *Wilbram et. al. (2008)* which is a series of ten interviews of primary carers for a hoarding family member. This narrative interview series presents a number of superordinate themes:

> [!Wilbram et. al. 2008]
> - loss of normal family life
> - the need for understanding
> - coping with the situation
> - impact on relationships
> - marginalization [^wilbram2008] 

When we don't have - or can't have - robust data to support our conclusion, all we have is a narrative understanding of the human impact that this "disorder" presents to the patient and their family. Even we don't find that these patients have a significant healthcare cost. These series of inteviews demonstrate not just disease but *suffering* [^hall2021][^loeser2000], and ultimately it is suffering that we are trained to treat.

## Comments and Extracts

> [!Snowdon et. al. 2012]
> It is estimated that 1 in 700 community-dwelling older people live in squalor.[^sowdon2012]

From the opening intro and methodology there seems to be a lack of analysis of the degree of social supports that patients have which *a priori* would have a significant impact on their ability to self-care.

> [!Lee et. al. 2022]
> A crucial implication for clinical practice is, in seeking to support the principle of autonomy, the cognitive capacity of older people living in severe domestic squalor who have frontal executive dysfunction needs to be carefully considered. This understanding is critical given that those who decline to cooperate with assessments may be even more impaired. ^q-autonomy

[^p1]: I guess this study is not looking for causitive factors in either direction but it seems that the confounding variable between squalor and abuse will be a lack of social supports  
[^p2]: This seems kind of a given that someone unable to take care of their own home would need to be cared for in supported accommodation. This however can be an argument against my point of social supports, as institutionalisation would imply that even with funded social supports, these patients were unable to return home.

abstract = {Older people living in squalor present healthcare providers with a set of complex issues because squalor occurs alongside a variety of medical and psychiatric conditions, and older people living in squalor frequently decline intervention. To synthesise empirical evidence on squalor to inform ethical decision-making in the management of squalor using the bioethical framework of principlism. A systematic literature search was conducted using Medline, Embase, {PsycINFO} and {CINAHL} databases for empirical research on squalor in older people. Given the limited evidence base to date, an interpretive approach to synthesis was used. Sixty-seven articles that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review. Our synthesis of the research evidence indicates that: (i) older people living in squalor have a high prevalence of frontal executive dysfunction, medical comorbidities and premature deaths; (ii) interventions are complex and require interagency involvement, with further evaluations needed to determine the effectiveness and potential harm of interventions; and (iii) older people living in squalor utilise more medical and social resources, and may negatively impact others around them. These results suggest that autonomous decision-making capacity should be determined rather than assumed. The harm associated with squalid living for the older person, and for others around them, means a non-interventional approach is likely to contravene the principles of non-maleficence, beneficence and justice. Adequate assessment of decision-making capacity is of particular importance. To be ethical, any intervention undertaken must balance benefits, harms, resource utilisation and impact on others. \copyright 2022 The Authors.
