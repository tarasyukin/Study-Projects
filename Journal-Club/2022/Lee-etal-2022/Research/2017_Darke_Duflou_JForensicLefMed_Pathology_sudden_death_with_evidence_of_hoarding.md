## Patients

"All cases presenting to the Department of Forensic Medicine Sydney (DOFM) between 1 January 2001&#8212;31 September 2015 where" there was compulsive hoarding noted on the autopsy file by the pathologist, police, or witnesses. (There is not indication how hoarding was verified or quantified.

%%
[P:: cases presenting to Department of Forensic Medicine Sydney, from 2001&#8212;2015, where hoarding was identified on the autopsy file]

Patients included, need to note number, exclusion criteria, how they were recruited, etc 

%% 

## Intervention 

Key data extracted from cases included:
- Cause of death as reported by the pathologist;
  - including antecedent causes and other clinically significant factors
- Age at death 
- Social circumstances  
- Internal autopsy findings 
- Toxicology data from immunoassay, gas or high-performance liquid chromatography 
  - primarily for commonly tested substances such as alcohol, opioids, cannabis, etc.

%% 
some studies don't have an intervention, essentially what was being tested for 
[I:: key data extracted: cause of death, age, toxicology, internal autopsy findings, social circumstances]

%%

## Control  

No formal controls were used. 
Years of life lost were calculated base on life expenctancy data from the Australia Bureau of statistics for the year of the patient case, and sex.

%% 
some studies may not have a clear control population 

[C:: no formal control, some comparison made to life expectancy data]
%%


## Outcome  

A total of 61 [N:: 61]

%% 
[O:: what was the raw results of the study]
%%

## Conclusion  

> [!Final Thoughts]
> In summary, the predominant clinical picture of sudden or unnatural deaths of pathological hoarders was of an isolated individual in very poor health. This is a group with a signi fi cant burden of disease that might bene fi t from more direct community level intervention.

%% what was the conclusion the researchers had come to at the end %%


## Comments and Extracts

> Hoarding Disorder has been recognised in DSM V as an independent diagnosis, characterised by an obsessive accumulation of objects causing functional impairment. The population prevalence was recently estimated at 5%, but may range up to 5%. 

> "The overall clinical picture was of an isolated group, with a heavy burden of physical disease and, in all probability, a high level of psychiatric disorders, who died alone in their homes."

abstract = {The study aimed to determine the characteristics and circumstances of cases sudden or unnatural death (n = 61) with evidence of pathological hoarding, their major organ pathology and toxicology. The mean age was 65·8 yrs (a mean of 16.1 years of potential life lost), 62·3\% were male, and 28·2\% were obese. 95·1\% lived alone, and 96·7\% died in their residence, with no medical intervention. In all cases severe squalor and extensive hoarding were noted. The direct cause of death was attributed to disease in 75·4\%, heart disease being a significant factor in 52·5\%. Accidents causing death directly related to hoarding occurred in two cases. Autopsy revealed extensive pathology: severe coronary artery narrowing (42·4\%), myocardial replacement fibrosis (44·1\%), emphysema (39·0\%), nephrosclerosis (46·6\%). Signs of hypothermia were present in 14·8\%, and diabetes was diagnosed in 21·3\%. The most commonly detected substance was alcohol (32·1\%). Medications for heart disease (5·4\%) or diabetes (7·1\%) were rare. The overall clinical picture was of an isolated group, with a heavy burden of physical disease and, in all probability, a high level of psychiatric disorders, who died alone in their homes.
