## Safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) against SARS-CoV-2: an interim analysis of four randomised controlled trials in Brazil, South Africa, and the UK


> There  were  74341  person-months  of  safety  follow-up  (median  3·4  months,  IQR  1·3–4·8):  175 severe adverse events occurred in 168 participants, 84 events in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 91 in the control group. Three events were classified as possibly related to a vaccine: one in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, one in the control group, and one in a participant who remains masked to group allocation.

### METHODS

Pooled data from 4 distinct trial of the ChAdOx1 (AZD1222) vaccine that essentially followed the same protocol, with a few discrepencies predominantly in the much earlier UK based trials.

The protocol was amended on  June  5,  2020,resulting  in  enrolment  of  two  distinct  groups  with  different  dosing  regimens  with  no  pause  in enrolment (version 6.0; appendix 2 p 330). A suite of assays  has  now  been  developed  for  characterisation  of  concentration  (which  confirmed  the  low  and  standard  dosing),   and   future   batches   are   all   released   with   a   specification  dose  of  3·5–6·5×10¹⁰  viral  particles,  and  this was used for the booster doses in the efficacy analysis presented here

|Study|Population|Intervention|Control|
|-----|----------|------------|-------|
|COV001 (Phase 1/2)|Healthy adults 18-55 yo (N = 1077) at five sites in the UK begining from April 23 2020; participants were randomised 1:1|Initially commenced as a single dose study of 5\*10^10 viral particles, trial protocol was modified on July 30 to include an unblinded second dose of the same vaccine; N=88 participants remained with only a single dose|control participants were administere the MenACWY conjugate vaccine|
|COV002 (Phase 2/3)|Healthy adults 18-55 yo were recruited from May 28 2020  to Jun 10 from 19 study sites targeting high risk populations; older adults 56-69 were enrolled from Aug 8, and adults &ge& 70 were enrolled from Aug 13|Initial participants were administered a low dose vaccine of 2.2\*10^10 viral particles as a single-dose protocol; the protocol was ammended on June 5 following a vaccine manufacturer error; the *first* recruits were then offered a second dose starting from Aug 3; participants after Jun 10 were given 2 dose at a new manufacturer criteria of 3.5 - 6.5\*10^10 viral particles|control participatns were given MenACWY|
|COV003 (Phase 3)|Participants 18 yo and older were recruited starting from Jun 23 at six sites across Brazil, particularly targeting high risk individuals, including those with stable pre-existing conditions|Two doses of 3.5-6.5\*10^10 viral particles doses were administered up to 12 weeks apart following protocol ammendmne on July 28 2020|Control participants were given a MenACWY plus saline for the second dose|
|COV005 (Phase 1/2)|Healthy adults age 18-65 without HIV were recruited from June 28 in south africa|Participants were given 3.5-6.5\*10^10 viral particles 4 weeks apart; 44 participants were given an first half-dose prior to adoption of new manufacturing methods|controls were given the MenACWY vaccine|


## Outcomes

of note the adverse outcomes described focus on a few cases of transverse myelitis, other events are not described
