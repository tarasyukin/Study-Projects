This interview based study sought to bring together carer and family perspectives of those with compulsive hoarding. This study was conducted before the introduction of *Hoarding Disorder* as a distinct clinical entity, although at a time when recognition of hoarding is not being exclusive to OCD was becoming more prominent in the literature.

## Patients

Families were recruited through a program called *OCD Action*. Patients in question were not necessarily diagnosed with OCD/hoarding, some were included based on carer's descriptions of a hoarder household.

%% 
[P:: Participants self-reported to a support group and were included if there was a diagnosis of hoarding, or a description sufficiently convincing of hoarding behaviour]

[N:: 10]

%% 

## Intervention 

Semi-structured interviews were conducted in participants homes and subjected to 8 *Interpretiv phenomenological analysis*.

%% 
[I:: Semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis]

%%

## Control  

%% 
[C:: ]

%%

## Outcome  

A number of themes were drawn from the interviews.
- Loss of ‘normal’ family life
- The need for understanding
- Coping with the situation
- Support and role division
- Impact on relationships
- Protective positive qualities
- Marginalization


%% 
[O:: A number of common themes could be drawn from the interviews, in general there was distress a loss of 'normality', with a frustration at the lack of emotion and societal support, and the straining of relationship including those with the patient in question]

%%

## Conclusion  

This study is of limited value in the assessment of hoarding behaviours among the elderly and squalid living situations.

A common theme amidst the literature is one of the impaired function whether in terms of physical limitations that lead to self-neglect and hoarding-like behaviour, or where patients impose limits on themselves by hoarding; and with a distinct psychiatric syndrome of severe, almost debilitating, anxiety at the prospect of relinquishing obviously useless posessions.

While it would be neat to extrapolate these carer experiences to carers of similar appearing patients, this would be unscientific. I would be happy to presume that carers of elderly residents with "squalor syndrome" suffer equally, it would be wrong to ascribe similar experience.

[comment:: this is unfortunately a psychiatry study that cannot be applied to "squalor syndrome"]

abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: This study explores the experiences of family members caring for a person who compulsively hoards. {DESIGN}: Ten participants, all 'key carers' for a hoarding family member, were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule designed for the purpose of the study. {METHODS}: Transcribed interviews were analysed using interpretive phenomenological analysis. {RESULTS}: Five superordinate, discrete but interconnecting themes were identified: 'loss of normal family life'; 'the need for understanding'; 'coping with the situation'; 'impact on relationships'; and 'marginalization'. Carers' accommodation of hoarding behaviours and role isolation were examined in drawing connections between themes. Outlying themes suggesting factors protective of relationships and facilitating coping were also identified. {CONCLUSION}: Carers struggled to cope with both the environmental and interpersonal impacts of the hoarding. Lacking both formal and informal networks of support, carers are in need of information and treatment options for themselves and their families. Possible avenues for future clinical and theoretical research are suggested.}
