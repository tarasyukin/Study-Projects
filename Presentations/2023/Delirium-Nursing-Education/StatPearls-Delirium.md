> Delirium is a clinical syndrome that usually develops in the elderly. It is characterized by an alteration of attention, consciousness, and cognition, with a reduced ability to focus, sustain or shift attention.

> The underlying cause of delirium can vary widely and involve anything that stresses the baseline homeostasis of a vulnerable patient.

> Multifactorial models have been accepted, describing delirium as an interaction of a vulnerable patient with predisposing factors exposed to noxious insults or precipitant factors

There are two groups of risk factors related to delirium: predisposing and precipitant factors. The most common predisposing factors are older age (older than 70 years), dementia (often not recognized clinically), functional disabilities, male gender, poor vision and hearing, and mild cognitive impairment. Alcohol use disorder and laboratory abnormalities have also been associated with an increased risk.

> However, medication side effects account for up to 39% of delirium cases

The nature of delirium is transient but can persist in patients with predisposing factors. A systematic review showed that hospital delirium persisted to the time of discharge in 45% of cases and persisted one month later in 33% of cases

Risk Factors:

1. **Increased Age**
	- Changes associated with age lead to diminished physiologic reserve and increased vulnerability to physical stress and illness. Some of the changes associated with age include decreased brain blood perfusion, increased neuron loss, and changes in the proportion of stress-regulating neurotransmitters. 
2. **Neuroinflammation**
	- Peripheral inflammatory insults damage endothelial cell-cell adhesions at the blood-brain barrier. The increased endothelial permeability promotes inflammation in the central nervous system, causing further damage, ischemia, and neuronal death. 
3. **Reactive Oxidation Species**
	- Reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species are a mediator of cellular damage. The central nervous system is particularly vulnerable to reactive oxygen species due to its high lipid content and low antioxidant capacity. 
4. **Circadian Rhythm Dysregulation**
	- Disruption in sleep duration and architecture and melatonin secretion leads to dysfunction of many systems. Melatonin affects many functions in the central nervous system, including regulation of sleep-wake cycles, glucose regulation, core body temperature, antioxidant defenses, and immune system response.
5. **Neurotransmitter Imbalance**
	- Delirium is associated with decreased acetylcholine and increased dopamine activity. The dopaminergic and cholinergic pathways overlap in the brain, and their balance is vital to brain function.
6. **Neuroendocrine**
	- Increased glucocorticoid release in response to physiologic stress increases the vulnerability of neurons to subsequent damage and impacts the regulation of gene transcription, cellular signaling, and glial cell behavior

> Delirium is a potential indicator of a life-threatening illness, and every episode of delirium should be appropriately evaluated.

Delirium is often referred to in 3 main manifestations. 

1) Hyperactive Delirium: Patients present with increased agitation and sympathetic activity. They can present with hallucinations, delusions, and occasionally combative or uncooperative behavior.

2) Hypoactive Delirium: Patients have increased somnolence and decreased arousal. Hypoactive delirium is dangerous as it is often unrecognized or mistaken for fatigue or depression. It is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. 

3) Mixed Presentation: Patients can fluctuate between Hyperactive and Hypoactive presentations.

A recent study estimated that delirium is unrecognized in up to 60% of cases ^[this is unsourced in the original text].

It is also imperative to carefully review recent and current medications. If possible, avoid drugs known to precipitate and perpetuate delirium, including psychoactive or anticholinergic medications.

Subjecting a delirious patient to medical evaluations can be stress-inducing and perpetuate delirium. It is advised to focus on the most probable diagnostic suspicions first. ^stress

The diagnosis of delirium is clinically based. There have been studies looking for biomarkers to help diagnose delirium, including inflammatory markers, cortisol, interleukins, and C-reactive protein. However, none have been validated for clinical application, such as diagnosis or monitoring.

Preventing delirium from occurring is the most efficacious intervention.

The overall prognosis for patients with delirium is guarded. 

Nurses are often the first to detect the presence of delirium and should communicate their concerns as soon as possible with the interprofessional healthcare team. All providers should maximize efforts to maintain a quiet environment for the patient, maximize sleep at night, encourage mobility, and nutrition, ensure patient safety and communicate with the patient and family.
