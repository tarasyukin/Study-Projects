If we want to proceed with studying the population of patients which have been found to live in squalor we should first come to some conclusions of what we mean. We have some heuristic idea of what we mean by squalor, or squalid patients, but this can be difficult to then breakdown to rigid inclusion and exclusion criteria.

If we mean all patients that would be considered as having a hoarding disorder we necessarily restrict our testable population to those with a psychiatric diagnosis and receiving some degree of psychiatric care.

Alternatively we might use the more vague defintion of "Squalor Syndrome" used by *Cybulska & Rucinski (1986)*:
