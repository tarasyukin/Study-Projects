# Pathologic Antibodies to Platelet Factor 4 afer ChAdOx1 nCov-19 Vaccination

April 16th  

> This study presents 23 patients that developed a rare thrombotic disorder following ChAdOx1 vaccination associated with thrombocytopaenia and anti-PF4 antibodies.

### Patients  

23 patients of median age 46 years old (range of 21 - 77), 16 of these patients younger than 50 years of age, 14 patients were female  

these patients had been well prior to their presentation to the reporting hospital with the exception of 1 patient with a history of DVT, and another with a history of OCP use.

### Intervention

All patients received their *first* dose of ChAdOx1 a median of 12 days (range, 6 - 24) before their presentation  

### Clinical Syndromes  

13 patients had symptoms consistent with Cerebral venous thrombosis  
4 had pulmonary embolism  
1 had DVT and adrenal haemorrhage  
2 had ischaemic stroke  
2 had portal vein thrombosis
1 patient presented with clinically significant bruising  

amongst these patients the median platelet count was 34 (range, 7 - 113)
median d-dimer with 31301 max 71859, lowest reported as only > 5000 so actual results is unknown  

### Outcomes

all patients had negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays at presentation  

10 patients were tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins  
all of these patients had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein within range of that have been following a single dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine  

5 patients had positive lupus anticoagulant, however did not have anti-&beta&1-glycoprotein or anti-cardiolipin antibodies  

al other testing for for thrombophilia and antinuclear antibodies were negative - although these are not described in detail  

All patients bar 1 tested positive for anti-PF4 antibodies via ELISA assay with 9 patients going on to have confirmatory testing with a HIT functional assay  

these functional assay did not demonstrate an increase in reactivity with the addition of heparin  - this is also true of serum from patients with HIT  

1 patient was negative for anti-PF4 antibodies

7 patients of this cohort died during their presentation  
1 patient underwent post-mortem examination demonstation disseminated small vessel thromobosis, particulary of the lungs, intestine, cerbreal veins, and venous sinuses
