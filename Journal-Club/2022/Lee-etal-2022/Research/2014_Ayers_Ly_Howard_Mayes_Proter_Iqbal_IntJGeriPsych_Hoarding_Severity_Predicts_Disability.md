> [!Aims]
> "This study examines the relationship between geriatric hoarding severity and disability in terms of frequency of essential task performance, functional limitations, and real-world consequences."

## Patients

Older adults were recruited from the San Diego region through essentially self-reporting means, by way of flyers, physician outreach, and adverts. 

The main inclusion criteria was a diagnosis of Hoarding Disorder, based on:
- Savings Inventory&#8212;Revised of &gt; 40
- UCLA Hoarding Severity Score of &gt; 20
- Hoarding Disorder diagnosed by 2 clinical psychologists

No age based inclusion criteria were stated. 

Exclusion criteria were:
- Change (start or cease) pyschiatric medications in last 3 months 
- Diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar, or expressed suicidal ideation 
- MoCA of &lt; 25 (keep in mind the MoCA can be quite difficult for under educated people, which could lead to some arguable spurious exclusion; however - spoiler alert - in this study the average years of schooling was 15)

%% 
[P:: Self-reported patients were included if they had a diagnosis of hoarding disorder, or scored sufficiently on at least 1 hoarding questionare; patients were exlcuded if they had a psychotic diagnois, or had MoCA &lt; 25]
[N:: 65]

## Intervention 

Patients were tested on hoarding severity, functional disability, and psychiatric symptoms. 

Hoarding severity was evaluated by a self-questionaire, the Savings Inventory&#8212;Revised, and a clinician administered UCLA Hoarding Severity Scale. Both of these have a [Likert-type](https://mwcc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Likert-Scale-Response-Options_MWCC.pdf) scale, with higher scores indicating greater severity.

Disability was assessed by the [Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument](https://www.bu.edu/sph/files/2011/06/LLFDI_Manual_2006_rev.pdf), which is _not_ Likert-type in that *higher values indicate greater function*; this has two questionaires:
- to assess *Disability* asking how often patients are able to, or feel limited in the ability to, manage general functions in their day-to-day life (examples questions include "taking care of the inside of your home", "taking care of your own health", etc)
- to assess *Function* asking difficulty in performing specific tasks such as using utensils, getting up from sitting, getting into cars, etc.

> In this study *only the Disability component* was examined. 

Subjects were also evaluated on a [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale](https://www.svri.org/sites/default/files/attachments/2016-01-13/HADS.pdf).

## Outcome  

Demographic outcomes:
- median age 66 yo
- 69.2% female
- 15.7 years education
- Employment
  - 18% disabled
  - 18% full-time employed
  - 43% Retired
- Marital status
  - 35% never married
  - 37% divorced/widowed
  - 26% married

Statistical analysis was used to calculated correlation between the hoarding severity scores to the functional assessment and anxiety/depression scale.

- Both hoarding scales were *postively* correlated with each other
- Both hoarding scales were *negatively* correlated with functional assessment (ie. higher scores of hoarding were correlated with lower scores of function)
- Both hoarding scales were *postively* correlated with anxiety/depression

## Conclusion  

From the authors:

> [!Key points]  
> - In older adults with HD, hoarding severity uniquely predicts functional disability. 
> - A clinician-administered measure of HD may be a better predictor than patient self-report measures. 
> - Multidisciplinary teams are needed to address the wide-ranging impairment associated with HD.

There is a fairly limited amount of variables being tested and no control in this study. Solid conclusions about functional status in hoarding patinets are difficult to draw from this study.

With regard to generalisability, there are significant elements of selection bias in the recruitment of this cohort. Significantly, no comparison is made to a population of elderly patients or other populations that may have less years of eduction, have lower rates of being employed or being married. In comparison to data from *Darke & Dulfou (2017)*[^darke2017] much more of these patients are married and (presumably) not living alone.

[^darke2017]: [[2017_Darke_Duflou_JForensicLefMed_Pathology_sudden_death_with_evidence_of_hoarding|Darke S, Duflou J. Characteristics, circumstances and pathology of sudden or unnatural deaths of cases with evidence of pathological hoarding. J Forensic Leg Med 2017;45:36–40.]]

Given these limitations, although this study confirms some of our preconceptions; I would be rather discard its findings entirely as so much noise given the lack of a control population and rather few variables analysed.

> [!Hoarding Disorder]  
> Hoarding disorder (HD) is a newly established psychiatric condition in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Volume 5 (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013). 
> Formerly known as compulsive hoarding, HD was previously considered a subtype of obsessive – compulsive disorder (OCD; Calamari et al ., 1999; Calamari et al ., 2004) and was included as one of eight criteria for obsessive – compulsive personality disorder.

It is thus important to note that publications before 2013 may be referring to hoarding as a subtype of OCD.

abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Late-life hoarding is a serious psychiatric condition with significant implications in health and functioning. Geriatric hoarding patients show greater impairment in activities of daily living and have a greater number of medical conditions compared with same-aged nonhoarders. This study examined the relationship between geriatric hoarding severity and functional disability severity. {METHODS}: Sixty-five subjects age 60 or older with hoarding disorder ({HD}) participated in the current study. Participants were assessed with measures of hoarding severity, psychiatric symptoms, and general disability. Hierarchical regression was used to test the unique association of hoarding symptoms with functional disability beyond the effects of demographic factors, anxiety, and depression. {RESULTS}: When controlling for demographics (age and gender) and psychiatric symptoms (anxiety and depression), hoarding severity predicts functional disability severity. Analyses also show that clinician-administered measures of hoarding are stronger predictors of disability than patient self-report measures. {CONCLUSIONS}: When treating older adults with {HD}, clinicians must consider symptom impact on daily life. A multidisciplinary team must be utilized to address the wide-ranging consequences of hoarding symptoms. Future work should examine how psychiatric treatment of {HD} affects functional disability.
