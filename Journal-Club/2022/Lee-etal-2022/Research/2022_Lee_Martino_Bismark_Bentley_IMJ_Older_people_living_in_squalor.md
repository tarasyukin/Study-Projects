[Lee SM, Martino E, Bismark M, Bentley R. Evidence to guide ethical decision-making in the management of older people living in squalor: a narrative review. Intern Med J 2022;52(8):1304–12.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35762169/)

> This is a narrative review of existing research in older patients living in squalor as there is limited quantitative evidence to direct care.

## Patients

Included studies:  
- Mean age of participanst &ge; 60 yo  
- search terms:
  - hoard, diogenes, squalor, clutter, elder, older, self-neglect, etc.

Excluded studies:
> Conference abstracts, case reports with *three or less participants*, expert opinions and review articles were excluded. The process of selection was performed by a single author (SML).

%% Patients included, need to note number, exclusion criteria, how they were recruited, etc %%  

Total studies included = 67 [N:: 67]

## Intervention 

Literature was coded based on a principilism framework:
1. Cognitive profile and that decision making 
2. Natural trajectory of squalid living 
3. Positive and Negative outcomes of intervention 
4. Utilisation of resources by older people, impact on others, and justice

%% some studies don't have an intervention, essentially what was being tested for %%

## Control  

%% some studies may not have a clear control population %%

## Outcome  

Key assertions based on principilism.
1. Cognition
    - There is a preponderance of executive dysfunction, not always rising to level of dementia [^ayers2016] [^ayers2013]
    - There is an associated with alcohol abuse/misuse [^gleason2015] - other substances not discussed
1. Natural History 
    - there is a mortality risk associated with squalor, this has not been robustly quantified, one study suggests ~ 16 years of life lost 
    - there is a higher risk of falls, elder abuse [^p1], and institutionalisation [^p2] 
1. Intervention 
    - CBT alone has minimal benefit, CBT with in-home support shows some improvement  
    - CREST[^d1] has some benefit that does not persist beyond 12 months  
    - Compassion-Focused Therapy has no strong evidence to it (this paper sites an uncontrolled study of 18 patients, I consider this essentially data-noise)  
    - Clean-ups provide some benefit to prolong tenancy  
    - Fire safety education may have modest benefit  
    - Neutering of cats has shown a reduction in animal numbers after 12 months  
1. Resource Utilisation 
    - Squalid patients typically have longer hospitalisations and discharged to supported accommodations  
    - Family and caregivers experience negative emotions, and family dysfunctions  (it is not stated if this is to a higher degree)  
    - Caregivers and volunteers require additional support as patients can be paranoid and demanding

## Comments and Extracts

> It is estimated that 1 in 700 community-dwelling older people live in squalor.[^sowdon2012]

From the opening intro and methodology there seems to be a lack of analysis of the degree of social supports that patients have which *a priori* would have a significant impact on their ability to self-care.

[^p1]: I guess this study is not looking for causitive factors in either direction but it seems that the confounding variable between squalor and abuse will be a lack of social supports  
[^p2]: This seems kind of a given that someone unable to take care of their own home would need to be cared for in supported accommodation. This however can be an argument against my point of social supports, as institutionalisation would imply that even with funded social supports, these patients were unable to return home.
