## Patients

Patients were referred to a community older person psychiatry service between 2000 to 2009 and selected for patients with evidence of squalor and over the age of 65 years old.

%% 
[P:: Patients with evidence of domestic squalor referred to old age psychiatry service]  
[N:: 173]

%% 

## Intervention 

Patients were stratified in Mild, Moderate, and Sever degrees of hoarding based on personal impression and hoarding severity scales.

Additional data on primary diagnosis, demographcis, home ownership, and animals was also collected.

%% 
[I:: Patients were stratified into mild, moderate, and severe degrees of squalor]

%%

## Control  

Patients were stratified by degrees of squalor, and comparison was made to patients in mild squalor.

%% 
[C:: 53 patients that were assess as living in mild squalor were analysed separately]

%%

## Outcome  

- 120 were living in moderate to severe squalor 
- 53 lived in mild squalor
- The median age across all patients was ~ 76 years of age
- in mod-severe squalor, 55% of males were never married, 12% of females
- in mild squalor, 47% of males were never married, 33% of females
- 25% of households had pets
	- only 2.9% of households had more than 3 animals  
- 81% of patients in mod-sever squalor lived alone
- Dementia was the primary diagnosis in all cases of squalor; 31% in mild, 46% in moderate, 26% in severe
- Substance abuse was the leading diagnosis in 38%, 24% and 10% (mild-mod-severe) cases
- Schizophrenia was the leading diagnosis in 15%, 8%, and 23%
- At 1 year after initial assessment
	- 32% of all patients had moved to long-term care
	- 47% remained in their same property (no comment is made with regard ot change in squalor severity)
	- 9% had died

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Although community psychiatric services commonly encounter cases where intervention is needed due to persons' unclean or cluttered living conditions, evidence concerning the referral rate and prevalence of severe domestic squalor is sparse. {METHODS}: Between 2000 and 2009, ratings of cleanliness and clutter have been made in all cases of people living in squalor who have been referred to an old age psychiatry service in Central Sydney. Where possible, one-year follow-up was arranged. {RESULTS}: 173 persons aged 65 years or more were referred to the service during the ten years and assessed as living in squalor (120 moderate or severe, two thirds of whom showed a moderate or severe degree of hoarding/clutter). Of 157 followed up after one year, 47\% were still at home, 32\% were in long-term care homes, 12\% had moved elsewhere, and 9\% had died. The annual new referral rate was close to 1 per 1000 elderly people in the catchment area, and of moderate or severe squalor was 0.66 per 1000. Limiting follow-up to those in moderate or severe squalor, 41\% were still at home one year later. Current findings suggest that the minimum prevalence in the community of older people living in moderate or severe squalor in Sydney is 1 per 1000. {CONCLUSIONS}: The costs of intervening in cases of severe domestic squalor are considerable. Increased attention and funding are warranted, as the incidence and prevalence are higher than had previously been estimated.}
