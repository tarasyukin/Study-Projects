# Shaw T, Shah A. Squalor syndrome and psychogeriatric admissions. Int Psychogeriatr 1996;8(4):669–74.

This study examined a series of patients admitted to a pyschogeriatric unit, with comparison to age-matched control.

> [!Squalor Syndrome]
> ...characterised by extreme self-neglect, domestic squalor, social withdrawal, apathy, tendency to hoard rubbish, and lack of shame. [^cybulska1986]

## Patients
16 patients were admitted to the psychogeriatric ward over a 40 -month period (the paper does not refer to this as *recruitment*). There are no explicit inclusion or exclusion criteria.

17 patients without squalor syndrom were selected for comparison (presumably from the same ward).

44% and 59% were female in the squalor and control groups.

50% and 53% were over 75 years of age in the squalor and control groups.

## Intervention 

No intervention was tested. 

The principle measurements were:
- Marital Status 
- Living alone
- Dependency at admission and discharge (this was arranged in a heirarchical manner from least to most dependent accommodation of home &rarr; home with support &rarr; residential aged care) 
- Principle diagnosis
- Prescribed use of psychotropic medication
- Length of Admission 
- Amount of services prior to admission. There is a non-complete list of services, however how these are quantified is not fully explained:
	- Community psychiatric nurses
	- District nurses
	- Social workers
	- Meals on wheels
	- Home help
	- Attendence to day centres 

%% 
some studies don't have an intervention, essentially what was being tested for
[I:: key measurements with marital and living status, level of dependency at admission and discharge, length of admission, principle diagnosis, number of services utilised prior to admission]
%%

## Control  

%% 
[C:: 17 patients without squalor syndrome were selected for comparison]
some studies may not have a clear control population 
%%

## Outcome  

Significant differences between the control [N:: 17 controls] and squalor groups [N:: 16]were:
1. Length of admission, patients with squalor syndrome having an average length of admission of 140 days, compared to 52  
2. Use of prescribed psychotropic medications, 0% in squalor patients, compared to 29% in the control
3. Receipt of services, patients with squalor syndrome received an average of 1.44 services, compared to 0.65 in the control group

Non-significant differences were:
1. 11 squalor patiens were discharged to a more dependent facility, compared to 5 in the control group 
2. 6% of squalor patients were married, compared to 29%
3. 94% of squalor patients lived alone, compared to 71% 
4. 50% had dementia, compared to 29% in controls
5. 25% had depression, compared to 52%
6. 44% of squalor patients had been legally detained, compared to 29% of controls

%% 
what was the raw results of the study
[O:: increased length of stay 140 days compared to 52]
[O:: low use of prescription psychotropics, 0% compared to 29%]
[O:: higher use of services, average 1.44 services compared to 0.65]

## Conclusion  

There are limited conclusions that can be drawn from this data other than this population being under-studied in 1996. 

Length of admission does appear to be a good signal to the complications that can arise in this population. 

The lack of medication use is consistent with other studies, in particular *Darke & Duflou (2017)* [^darke2017]. In such a population of particularly elderly patients untreated medical commorbidities would likely have some degree of risk of harm.

[^darke2017]: [[2017_Darke_Duflou_JForensicLefMed_Pathology_sudden_death_with_evidence_of_hoarding|Darke S, Duflou J. Characteristics, circumstances and pathology of sudden or unnatural deaths of cases with evidence of pathological hoarding. J Forensic Leg Med 2017;45:36–40.]]

In contrast to other data (being a single other study), this case-control trial suggests not only increased utilisation of services, but also discharge to a higher-dependency facility. Both of these would incur greater cost, however in *Franzini & Dyer (2008)* [^franzini2008] there was not only less cost to the healthcare system prior to referral of this population, and no significant difference in cost at one year. 

[^franzini2008]: [[2008_Franzini_Dyer_JAmGeriatrSoc_Healthcare_costs_of_vulnerable_elderly_people|Franzini L, Dyer CB. Healthcare costs and utilization of vulnerable elderly people reported to Adult Protective Services for self-neglect. J Am Geriatr Soc 2008;56(4):667–76.]]

However, this is a *gross* mal-comparison, as the latter study had been conducted in different country with a different healthcare system, and was not of inpatients.

Patients with squalor syndrome received a greater number of services prior to admission, were less likely to be on psychotropic medication prior to admission, had longer length of hospital admission, and were discharged to a "more dependent" accommodation facility. These findings, methodological difficulties, and avenues for future research are discussed.}
