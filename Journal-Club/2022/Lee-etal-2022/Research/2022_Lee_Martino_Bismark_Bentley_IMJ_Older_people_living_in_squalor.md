> This is a narrative review of existing research in older patients living in squalor as there is limited quantitative evidence to direct care.

## Patients

Included studies:  
- Mean age of participanst &ge; 60 yo  
- search terms:
  - hoard, diogenes, squalor, clutter, elder, older, self-neglect, etc.

Excluded studies:
> Conference abstracts, case reports with *three or less participants*, expert opinions and review articles were excluded. The process of selection was performed by a single author (SML).

%% Patients included, need to note number, exclusion criteria, how they were recruited, etc %%  

Total studies included = 67 [N:: 67]

## Intervention 

Literature was coded based on a principilism framework:
1. Cognitive profile and that decision making 
2. Natural trajectory of squalid living 
3. Positive and Negative outcomes of intervention 
4. Utilisation of resources by older people, impact on others, and justice

%% some studies don't have an intervention, essentially what was being tested for %%

## Control  

%% some studies may not have a clear control population %%

## Outcome  

Key assertions based on principilism.
1. Cognition
  - There is a preponderance of executive dysfunction, not always rising to level of dementia  
  - There is an associated with alcohol abuse/misuse [^gleason2015] - other substances not discussed

%% what was the raw results of the study %%

## Conclusion  

%% what was the conclusion the researchers had come to at the end %%

## Comments and Extracts

> It is estimated that 1 in 700 community-dwelling older people live in squalor. [^sowdon2012]

From the opening intro and methodology there seems to be a lack of analysis of the degree of social supports that patients have which *a priori* would have a significant impact on their ability to self-care.
