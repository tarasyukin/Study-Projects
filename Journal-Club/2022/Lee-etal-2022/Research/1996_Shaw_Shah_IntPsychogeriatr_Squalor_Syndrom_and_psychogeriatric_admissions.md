abstract = {A series of patients with the squalor syndrome who were admitted to a psychogeriatric ward were compared with those without the syndrome. Patients with squalor syndrome received a greater number of services prior to admission, were less likely to be on psychotropic medication prior to admission, had longer length of hospital admission, and were discharged to a "more dependent" accommodation facility. These findings, methodological difficulties, and avenues for future research are discussed.}
