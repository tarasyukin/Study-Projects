# Thrombotic Thrombocytopaenia after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 Vaccination  

> This german study describes several cases of unusual thombotic events associated with thrombocytopaenia among 11 patients developing after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine  

April 9

### Patients  

11 patients were identified following the presentation of an initial index case  

median age was 26 rane, 22 - 49  
9 of eleven patients were women  

one patient had pre-existing vWF, anticardiolipin and FVL

no patient received heparin  

and addition 27 patients who are not described but were diagnosed with VITT were also included in the immunoassay study  

## Interventions

participants received vaccination with ChAdOx1 in the prior 5 - 16 days, first or second dose is not specified  

## Clinical Syndromes

the index case was a 49F who developed fevers and chills and epigastric pain day 5 following vaccination, and was admitted to hospital on day 10  
- had a platelt count of 18  
- positive d-dimer of 35  
- negative SARS-CoV-2
- peipheral pulmonary emboli on CT  
- developed portal vein thrombosis including the splenic and upper mesenteric veins  
eventually this patient died following catsatrophic gastrointestinal haemorrhage that was unable to be reverse with platelet transfusion, prothrombinex and factor VIIa  
was found to have cerberal venous thrombosis at autopsy  

9 patients had cerebral venous thrombosis  
3 patients had splanchnic vein thrombosis  
3 patients had pulmonary emboli  
4 patients had additional undescribed thrombosis  
5 patients had more than one event  

## Outcomes

All patients demonstrated positive ELISA immunoassay for anit-PF4 and anti-PF4-Heparin  

the binding was reduce in the present of unfractionated heparin  

almost all patient serum demonstrated platelet activation in the presence of PF4 (2 outliers)  

this was not affected by LWMH and reduced by UFH
